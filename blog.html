        <h2>Hey Cryptography... Didn't See You There!</h2>

            Last night, I found myself sending an email to my school counselor. Right before I hit send, I noticed something I never had before. To the right of the name of the recipient of my email, I saw a little gray lock labeled ‘standard encryption.’ Before class just a day ago, this word has never had any meaning to me. Now that I recognize the word, I decided to click on it and dive deeper into its purpose. Next, this message was displayed: “your message will be sent with regular security. All recipients use services that support standard encryption.” I went on to learn that all emails associated with my school are equipped with TLS, or standard encryption. This is a protocol that helps provide privacy between communicating applications and their users during email delivery. When a server and client communicate, TLS ensures that no third party can overhear or tamper with any messages.

            I had no idea that cryptography was the reason that all of the emails that I send are private and secure, and I send a lot of emails! Through just this task and application, I am influenced by cryptography every single day. Also, the lock on the upper-right corner of my emails is not always gray. Sometimes it is red, which has always looked concerning to me, but I did not know exactly why. It turns out that this symbol means that the email has no encryption at all, which means that it is not secure. Gmail does not recommend that people send confidential information when this symbol appears, which I am glad I know now! Because of the privacy that encryption secures through email, I believe that cryptography is positive. It is hard to imagine a world without it, as encryption and decryption happen in seconds behind the scenes throughout so much of modern technology. After all, who knows who could view my class schedule for next year without it!
