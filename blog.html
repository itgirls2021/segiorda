        <h2>When Machine Learning Gets Personal</h2>
        <p>Sammy Giordano / July 22, 2021</p>
        <p>
            Every filter on Snapchat, Instagram, or TikTok utilizes machine learning to enable facial recognition. Without machine learning, the cameras would not know where to place and mold the filter. However, even when the filter is programmed to correctly align with a face, the filter itself being displayed is not always right. There are a few popular filters that act as a mask over people’s faces, and display a cartoon version of themselves. Oftentimes, these filters have two versions- a ‘boy’ option and a ‘girl’ option. The filters are programmed to assign the ‘boy’ version to their learned definition of a boy face, and the same for the girl version. To do this, professionals are inputting their own perspective of what a boy or a girl looks like into their code. This is an example of the coded gaze. Professionals are teaching their machines to reinforce harmful gender stereotypes. Gender identity and gender expression are not the same thing, and you are not able to tell what gender someone is just by looking at them. In my opinion, the goal is for code and the greater world to stop gendering things when it is not necessary, such as a filter on an app. In code specifically, professionals need to make sure that their data sets are expansive and diverse enough to challenge their own personal views, as humans will always have bias. Bias is not inherently bad, but can become an issue when it impacts our actions that are displayed as objective.

            On a lighter note, the teachable machine I created in class was a simple and fun take on machine learning. The ‘2020’ Olympic Games are quickly approaching, and my favorite event has especially been on my mind- gymnastics. I taught my machine to identify which event is happening in a picture of someone competing in the Olympic sport. While my motive at the time was to simply entertain my interest, this idea was probably the foundation of a program to enhance the experience of the visually impaired. Some people whose disability affects their vision may use a program on their phone that identifies an image and speaks the content back to them so that they can enjoy it. Since my machine now knows which event is happening in a picture, the next step would be to program it to audibly communicate that information back to the user.

        <h2>Hey Cryptography... Didn't See You There!</h2>
        <p>Sammy Giordano / July 21, 2021</p>
        <p>
            Last night, I found myself sending an email to my school counselor. Right before I hit send, I noticed something I never had before. To the right of the name of the recipient of my email, I saw a little gray lock labeled ‘standard encryption.’ Before class just a day ago, this word has never had any meaning to me. Now that I recognize the word, I decided to click on it and dive deeper into its purpose. Next, this message was displayed: “your message will be sent with regular security. All recipients use services that support standard encryption.” I went on to learn that all emails associated with my school are equipped with TLS, or standard encryption. This is a protocol that helps provide privacy between communicating applications and their users during email delivery. When a server and client communicate, TLS ensures that no third party can overhear or tamper with any messages.

            I had no idea that cryptography was the reason that all of the emails that I send are private and secure, and I send a lot of emails! Through just this task and application, I am influenced by cryptography every single day. Also, the lock on the upper-right corner of my emails is not always gray. Sometimes it is red, which has always looked concerning to me, but I did not know exactly why. It turns out that this symbol means that the email has no encryption at all, which means that it is not secure. Gmail does not recommend that people send confidential information when this symbol appears, which I am glad I know now! Because of the privacy that encryption secures through email, I believe that cryptography is positive. It is hard to imagine a world without it, as encryption and decryption happen in seconds behind the scenes throughout so much of modern technology. After all, who knows who could view my class schedule for next year without it!
