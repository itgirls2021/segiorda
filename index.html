        <h1>Sammy Giordano's Biography</h1>
        <p>
            Hi everyone! I hope you all are doing well. I'm Sammy from Toledo, Ohio and I am a rising senior in high school.

            Since I'm going to be thinking about college majors soon, I'm hoping that this class will help me to organize and prioritize that side of my mind, since it can get pretty messy up there. I have many interests- from technology, to business, to politics, to journalism, so I am always eager to narrow in on one as to make my future academic decisions a little easier. I also adore both <strong>Syracuse and the iSchool</strong>, which doesn't hurt :)

            Within the world of technology, I'm interested in data analytics, media algorithms, and how to harness the power of the internet to create wide social change. I'm new to all of the hard science that goes into computer programming.

            For more on my background- I go to a small, private, Catholic, all-girls school, which has certainly unconsiously impacted my world view, so I'm very ready to branch out in college to a more progressive and inclusive environment- like the one here!

            One of my favorite activities I'm involved in is my school's broadcast journalism program, so you can always catch me on the morning announcements. Outside of school, I'm a long-time member of my local theatre community and am an active member of student government.

            I love my cats, reality tv (especially RuPaul's Drag Race), and Mario Kart. See you on the first day, and go orange!
